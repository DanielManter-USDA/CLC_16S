Sequencing platform and workflows strongly influence microbial community sequence results with potential errors introduced at each step. This study evaluated the potential sources of variability and error at three main steps of a standardized amplicon sequencing workflow (DNA extraction, polymerase chain reaction [PCR], and sequencing) in a cross-laboratory design with agricultural soils from two sites and a simple mock community using the Oxford Nanopore MinION platform. Variability increased with each step in the workflow with PCR errors and differences in library size greatly influencing α and β-diversity estimates. Common bioinformatics diagnostics and a simple mock community were ineffective in detecting PCR abnormalities. This work outlines several diagnostic checks and techniques to account for differences in sequencing depth to ensure accuracy and reproducibility in soil microbial community analyses. The use of these diagnostics and inclusion of a reference soil will facilitate future studies that necessitate the comparison of multiple sequencing runs.
