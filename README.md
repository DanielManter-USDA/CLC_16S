# Unveiling Errors in Soil Microbial Community Sequencing: A Case for Reference Soils and Improved Diagnostics

Sequencing platform and workflow strongly influence microbial community sequence results through potential errors introduced at each step. This cross-laboratory study evaluated the sources of variability and error at three main steps of a standardized amplicon sequencing workflow (DNA extraction, polymerase chain reaction [PCR], and sequencing) using the Oxford Nanopore MinION platform to analyze two agricultural soils and a simple mock community. Variability in sequence results occurred at each step in the workflow with PCR errors and differences in library size greatly influencing α- and β-diversity estimates. Common bioinformatic diagnostics and a simple mock community were ineffective at detecting PCR abnormalities. This work outlines several diagnostic checks and techniques to account for differences in sequencing depth to ensure accuracy and reproducibility in soil microbial community analyses. These diagnostics and inclusion of a reference soil can help ensure the validity and comparison of multiple sequencing runs both within and between laboratories.
